-- GraphWrapper
--
-- This package extends GHC's Data.Graph package to be more accessible.
--
-- GHC's package uses a contiguous range of Int as nodes, for fast
-- indexing into arrays.  This util package provides functions for
-- converting back and forth to this representation.
--
-- This package also defines a cycle detection function based on
-- the available graph functions, since one is not available.

--     note that the GHC graph is mutable so addEdge can be efficient
--     we use unsafe hackery to get the immutable graph the GHC libraries expect
--  * mapping of nodes to their key
--  * mapping of keys to node
