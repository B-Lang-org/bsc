-- ========================================================================
-- RelaxMethodEarliness utilities
--

-- There are three ways of handling rules vs methods in the execution
-- order ("earliness" order):
--
-- (1) The most conservative method (currently our default) is to
--     enforce that rules always execute after methods.  This is enforced
--     by adding SB relationships from all methods to all rules.
--     Annotations on methods can then be computed pairwise between
--     methods, without consulting the schedule.
--
-- (2) A less conservative method is to allow rules to fall wherever they
--     may, as long as it does not violate the pair-wise method annotations.
--     For instance, a rule cannot fall between two parallel composable
--     methods if the rule would enforce a sequential order on the execution
--     of all three.  This is because any parallel methods have the
--     potential to be call together in one atomic action.  If a rule fired
--     between the methods, the method execution would not be atomic.
--     Another situation to watch for is when a rule sequences between two
--     methods, but in the opposite order that the methods need to sequence.
--     One has to drop cycles in a way that doesn't affect the methods.
--
-- (3) The most free situation is to add no conflicts to the graphs --
--     to allow rules to fall where they may.  And then to compute the
--     method annotations as dictated by the schedule.  So if a rule falls
--     between two parallel methods, those methods become sequenced.
--
-- In situations 2 and 3, we do bias rules to be after methods in the

-- ========================================================================
-- Sequentializing the scheduling and execution of rules

-- The "combined" graph is a graph with separate nodes for rule scheduling
-- and rule execution.  It is called "combined" because we create it by
-- combining the urgency and execution graphs.  That is, each node in the
-- urgency graph is considered to be a "scheduling" node and each node in
-- the execution-order graph is considered to be an "execution" node.
-- (Both of these graphs have been checked for cycles, and are therefore
-- known to be acyclic.)  We combine these sets of node and edges, and
-- add edges from the scheduling node of each rule/method to the
-- execution edge of the same rule/method (since scheduling has to happen
-- before execution).  Once the two sets of nodes are joined in this way,
-- we can again look for cycles and report them.

-- XXX The above technique is not correct!
-- Technically, the nodes in the separate urgency and execution-order
-- graphs are representing the ENTIRE rule -- both scheduling and execution.
-- To say that an edge in the execution-order graph is only from execution
-- node to execution node is bogus.  Similarly for the urgency graph.
-- How do we fix this?
-- For execution order:
--   When we analyze what methods are used by a rule, we DO have separate
--   lists of which methods are used in the predicate and which in the body.
--   When we create edges in the conflict map, we treat all uses as an
--   atomic whole.  But we COULD create separate edges in the "combined"
--   graph for uses in the predicate (scheduling) and uses in the body
--   (execution).  It turns out that we're ok leaving the edges as purely
--   being among the execution nodes.  Why?  The scheduling of a rule has
--   to come before its execution, so an edge that says that the execution
--   has to come before another rule is also enforcing that the scheduling
--   has to come before.  The only remaining case is an edge from the
--   execution of rule A to the scheduling of rule B, where currently the
--   edge is to the execution of rule B.  The only uses in rule B's
--   predicate are value methods.  So, given that value methods are
--   always conflict free with value methods, the only way that a method
--   call by rule A can effect rule B is by an action method with a path.
--   This situation we will take care of by adding edges to the combined
--   graph for paths.  It is ok to leave the existing edge (to the rule
--   execution), because an edge to the scheduling node implies an order
--   before the execution.
-- For urgency order:
--   The only problem in the urgency graph is in the accounting for paths
--   (all other edges are legitimately about scheduling order).  But a
--   path is technically implying that execution of rule A must be before
--   the scheduling of rule B -- and this just happens to imply that rule A
--   must be scheduled first, because scheduling of rule A happens before
--   the execution of rule A.  In the separate urgency graph, we just make
--   an edge between scheduling nodes -- for the purpose of detecting cycles
--   and reporting them.  When we create the combined graph, we should
--   correct the edges to be from execution to scheduling.  It is ok to
--   leave the old edge from scheduling to scheduling, since that order is
--   implied by the more correct edges.

-- vSchedInfo
--

-- This function generates the external scheduling info (the annotations)
-- for interface methods (for all ifcRuleNames).
--
-- This gets slightly tricky when we allow rules to intermingle with
-- methods, because two methods which might otherwise have been CF might
-- become SB because of a rule which has to order in between them.
-- We don't have to worry about two methods which are SB in one direction
-- having a rule which sequences between the two in the other direction,
-- because cycle dropping will have caught that.
--
-- Thus, the algorithm is this:  Use the same algorithm as before, for
-- finding pairwise relationships between methods by consulting only the
-- edges between those methods in the conflict graphs ... and if that
-- information says that the methods are conflict free, then do a second
-- check to see if an intermediate rule has changed that.  And if so,
-- we change the annotation.  We don't issue a warning about this, except
-- when a trace flag is on, because it's only interesting to developers.
--
-- Note that in revision 2894, Lennart rewrote the basic algorithm into
-- two loops (and outer and an inner) to speed up computation.

-- Rule(s) between methods, rule(s) before methods

-- This function returns two sets of data:
-- * Pairs of methods for which there is a rule (or rules) which must execute
--   between them (specifically, there is a path in the combined scheduling
--   graph from the execution of one method to the execution of another,
--   passing through rules), and the names of the rules
-- * Methods which have a rule (or rules) that must execute before the method

-- These are done in the same function because they share the same
-- data: the reachability graph from rules to methods.

-- For rules between methods:
-- (Paths through other methods are not considered, because they only
-- matter if that method is called, in which case the pairwise
-- annotations with that method will be considered.  If just the outer
-- methods are used, they should not be restricted.)

-- Approach: Construct the forward graph with no outgoing edges from
-- any method and compute reachables to methods from each rule.  Then,
-- for each method pair, check if any of the outgoing rules from
-- the execution node of m1 can reach m2 (the exec node, but if it can
-- reach the scheduling node, it can also reach the exec node).

-- An alternative might be: Make a graph of just the rules and compute
-- the pairs (r,rs) where rs are reachable from r.  For each method,
-- make a list of outgoing and ingoing edges (to rules only).  Take
-- the outgoing rs from m1, find the union of their reachable rules,
-- and test if any of those are in the ingoing rules to m2.

-- Conflict graph routines
--

-- Build a conflict graph for CF, PC, or SC

-- Conflict test
--   Given a set of the CF/PC/SC pairs from the SchedInfo of all
--   submodule instances, a conflict test is produced between rules
--   to determine whether the rules are CF/PC/SC.

--   Note that this requires the SchedInfo of submodules to be
--   complete (if the relationship for a pair of methods is not
--   specified, it will be assumed to not be CF/PC/SC).

--   Note that this requires the SchedInfo to be unique for each pair
--   (SB/SBR indicates the ability to compose in that direction and
--   not the inability to compose in the other direction; "a SB b, b
--   SB a" would be taken by this function to mean composable in both
--   directions, thus the parser should ban two different
--   relationships for the same pair).

-- Inputs:
--   ncset = no conflict CF/PC/SC set
--           (all CF/PC/SC method pairs in submodule SchedInfo)
--   ignore_conflicts = func to query to see if we are checking conflicts
--      (For CF: rules are disjoint or annotated conflict-free,
--       For PC/SC: rules are already CF according to the CF map)
--   rmap = rule method use map (info on which methods are uses by each rule)

-- Output:
--   A graph with a node for every rule/method.  There will be an edge
--   between two nodes if the two rules are not disjoint (in the case of CF)
--   or already captured in the CF graph (in the case of PC/SC)
--   and if the two rules use a pair of methods that conflict (ruling out
--   CF/PC/SC).
--   A set of pairs of rules, where existence in the set means that
--   method calls between the rules were ignored because their conditions
--   were disjoint.  This is used to limit the set of pairs that need to
--   be tested later for static scheduling (if the ignored calls had a rule
--   between them that would require dynamic scheduling).

-- The type aliases resolve to these types:
--   NoConflictSet    :: Set (MethodId,MethodId)
--   RuleDisjointTest :: ARuleId -> ARuleId -> Bool
--   RuleUsesMap      :: M.Map RuleId RuleUses

-- ----------
-- verifyStaticScheduleTwoRules

-- Go through all pairs of rules (or methods) of a module and check
-- that all pairs of method calls (on the same state) can be composed
-- with a static schedule.

-- Note that rule-between-methods is already accounted for in the conflict
-- info for those methods, so pairs of rules/methods whose execution order
-- already takes into account all method call pairs are OK.  We only need
-- to check those rule/method pairs where the method calls were not taken
-- into account: (1) the rule predicates are disjoint (CAN_FIRE is disjoint),
-- (2) the rules/methods are made to conflict (WILL_FIRE is disjoint),
-- or (3) some method call pairs were ignored because the conditions of the
-- calls were disjoint.  The first two are determined by consulting the DB;
-- the third is passed in as a set.

-- We also return rule pairs used to create some arbitrary choice edges,
-- so that we can be sure that, where possible, the arbitrary
-- ordering choices between pairs of (asserted) ME and CF rules
-- do not conflict with the ordering required for a static schedule
-- Any rule pairs whose implied edge creates a cycle are suppressed
-- (since those rule pairs taint the backend by requiring dynamic scheduling)
-- However, even if the backend is tainted, we return all safe rule pairs,
-- to minimize Bluesim/Verilog differences
