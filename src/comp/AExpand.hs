-- Functions: aExpand, aXExpand, xaXExpand

-- Inline some definitions into other definitions, the submodule
-- instantiations, and foreign function calls, based on some
-- heuristics (see aExpDefs for details).  In this process, remove any
-- definitions which are not used, but keep some types of definitions
-- (again, see aExpDefs).

-- Finally, aSRemoveUnused and xASRemoveUnused are used to make sure
-- that unused definitions are removed, though some types of
-- definitions are kept.  (aExpand and aXExpand only remove unused
-- "_d" definitions, while xaXExpand can remove any unused
-- definition.)

-- XXX Can aExpand, aXExpand, and xaXExpand be merged into one?
-- XXX aExpand and aXExpand are the same, and xaXExpand is slightly
-- XXX different in the way that it removes definitions.

-- The X versions were for when there was a recursive data structure
-- used in the Verilog back-end (at some point ASPackage became a
-- recursive structure) and these versions were need to expand on that
-- structure.  xaXExpand might have a been version for allowing
-- expansion from a point inside the recursive structure.

-- Function: aExpDefs

-- aExpDefs acts on the "ss", "ds", and "fs" fields of the ASPackage.
--   ss :: [AVInst]       = state elements
--   ws :: [AId]          = ports of inlined modules (RWire)
--   ds :: [ADef]         = local definitions
--   fs :: [AForeignCall] = foreign function calls
-- It takes as input the schedule and the "os" (:: [AOutput] = ifc outputs)
-- aExpDefs does this:
-- (1) Find the variables that each definition (in "ds") uses.
-- (2) Make a list of the ids of the "ds".
-- (3) Find all the ids used by "ss", "ds", and "fs", and then zip them
--     with 1 or 2 depending on whether they are used 1 or multiple times
--     (and for uses in "ss" and "ws", always zip them with 2, because it's
--     more readable not to inline "ss" and aids debugging for "ws"),
--     and convert it into a map (for quick lookup).
-- (4) Produce a list of Ids to "keep".  This includes:
--        CAN_FIRE_ and WILL_FIRE signals,  (XXX which are re-made)
--        the outputs of the module ("os"),
--        and the definitions ("ds") which are state I/O
--        (XXX This is currently checked by looking for "$" in the name
--         XXX It should at least use ASyntax::isMethId)
-- (5) Create the ExpandData data structure with:
--        skeepFire = whether to preserve rule firing signals (keepFires flag)
--        sexpnond  = whether to expand "non-d"efs (expandATSdef flag)
--        sexpcheap = whether to inline "cheap" operations (inlineBool flag)
--        suses  = the usemap from step 3 (a map to the rough number of uses)

--        sss    = ss
--        sws    = ws
--        sfs    = fs
-- (6) Make a graph of how the Ids in "ds" depend on each other, and tsort
--     to flatten it to a list.  If there are cycles, report an ECombCycle.
--     Otherwise, put "ds" in the flattened (dependency) order.
-- (7) Call "expand" on the ordered definitions, with the ExpandData

-- ==============================
-- Function: getUses

-- getUses is used on the number-of-uses map, which maps an Id to
-- either 1 or 2, depending on whether it is used once or many times.
-- If the Id to be looked up is not in the map, then getUses returns 0.

-- ==============================
-- Function: inlineable

-- "inlineable" is another test for whether to inline an expression or not
-- (even if it is "simple"!)
--
--  * A TaskValue should not be inlined because it exists to grab a name
--    for the corresponding system task call to when Verilog is generated
--  * Foreign function calls are not inlineable (except for the cases in mustInline)
--  * NoInline module function calls are not inlineable
--  * A method call cannot be inlined
--  * A Mux or PriMux primitive cannot be inlined
--  * PrimArrayDynSelect is not inlined, because we always want it to be
--    converted to a case (which only happens for defs)
--  * Everything else can be inlined

-- Function: mustInline
-- These are expressions that are required to be inlined regardless of

-- There are two kinds of such expressions:
--  - String expressions
--     (conditional muxes involving strings must be unfolded in veriquirks)
--     XXX: If we allow foreign functions returning strings we'll have to be
--          more careful here

--    (since they only work if inlined into the appropriate system task call)

-- ==============================
-- Function: expand

-- the core expander loop (called by aExpDefs)

-- "expand" takes the ExpandData structure and a list of definitions (in
-- dependency order) and it returns the updated submodule instantiations,
-- list of definitions, and foreign function calls (ss', ds', fs').

-- The computation is done recursively, by starting with two empty
-- maps -- a map of Ids to the expressions which should replace them
-- (when inlining)
-- and an empty list "nds" which will become the new
-- definitions (thus "nds").

-- For each definition "i" which is considered,
--  * if the number of uses is zero and it is not in the keep list,
--    then the definition is added to the "nds", but with any inlined
--    Ids substituted into the definition.
--  * if the Id is to be inlined, then it is added to the map.  An Id
--    is inlined if it is a local Id (starts with "_d") or if the
--    expandATSdef flag is on (in which case all Ids are fair game) and
--    it is not a rule firing signal (unless keepFires is off) and it is
--    inlineable (according to the function "inlineable") and either it
--    is only used in one place or it is a simple expression (according
--    to the function "isSimple", applied to the expression with inlined
--    definitions substituted in).

-- When all definitions have been considered, it returns:
--  * the list of AVInst ("ss") with inlining applied to the "es" of
--    the instantiation.
--  * the list of definitions, in dependency order (thus the call to
--    "reverse" after compiling the "nds")
--  * the list of foreign function calls ("fs") with inlining applied
--    to the "es"
