# Check for trailing whitespace

# For now, restrict to Haskell/Bluespec code as we've a lot of third party
# vendored code in the repo that we don't want to needlessly modify

# We should at least look for both trailing space (' ') and tab ('\t').
# By using '\s' in the grep pattern, we also check for CR ('\r') and
# LF ('\f').  If we wanted to allow DOS files (that end lines with \r\n)
# then the grep pattern would need to be '( |\t|\f)\r?$' so that we detect
# spaces and tabs that are followed by CR (and thus not fully trailing).

# Files can be exempted from the check by adding a pattern to the
# 'allow_whitespace.pats' file.  For example, some parser tests need to
# check BSC's behavior on files containing whitespace.
