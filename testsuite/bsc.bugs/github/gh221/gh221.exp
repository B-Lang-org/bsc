# GitHub Issue #221

# All of these examples used to fail with an internal error, when
# bsc had buggier and more limited handling of type synonyms.
# Now they either compile or fail with proper errors.

# The type synonyms are fine, but there is another error
# (a missing Bits instance)

# Add the Bits instance and the example compiles

# The type synonyms are still fine, but there is a different

# A LiberalTypeSynonyms example from GHC
# Previously failed with a partially applied type synonym error
# With LiberalTypeSynonyms implemented, it compiles.

# Previously failed with an unbound constructor error, which isn't
# really accurate. Foo is bound, but it isn't a constructor.
# Now it fails with an accurate partially-applied type synonym error.
