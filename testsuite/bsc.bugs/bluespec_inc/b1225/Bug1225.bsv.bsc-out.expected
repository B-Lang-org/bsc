Error: "Bug1225.bsv", line 11, column 16: (T0030)
  The provisos for this expression are too general.
  Given type:
    Bit#(vsz)
  The following provisos are needed:
    Bits#(Vector::Vector#(n, a_T), vsz)
      Introduced at the following locations:
	"Bug1225.bsv", line 11, column 22
      The proviso could also be deduced from the following information:
	Bits#(a_T, a__),
	Mul#(n, a__, vsz)
