compiling OrphanInstance.bsv
Warning: "OrphanInstance.bsv", line 9, column 10: (T0127)
  Exporting orphan typeclass instance Helper::Describable#(Bool). The
  instance's typeclass as well as all of the instance's source type parameters
  are defined in other packages. This can lead to confusing and inconsistent
  instance resolution if the orphan instance is not imported everywhere it
  could be used.
All packages are up to date.
