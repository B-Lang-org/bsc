Compiler, simulator, and tools for the **Bluespec Hardware Description
Language**. Bluespec is a single language for digital electronic hardware designs that comes in
two syntactic flavors, which are interchangeable:

  - Bluespec **SystemVerilog** (BSV)
  - Bluespec **Haskell** (BH, or "Bluespec Classic")

Bluespec is a *high-level* hardware description language. It has a variety of
advanced features including a powerful type system that can prevent errors
prior to synthesis time, and its most distinguishing feature, **Guarded Atomic
Actions**, allow you to define hardware components in a modular manner based on
their invariants, and let the compiler pick a scheduler.

The toolchain was under development by [Bluespec Inc] for almost 20 years, and
has been proven repeatedly in production designs like [Flute], [Piccolo], and
[Shakti].

The Bluespec compiler `bsc` emits standard Verilog for maximum compatibility
with any synthesis toolchain and comes with an included simulator ("bluesim"),
standard library, and TCL scripting support ("bluetcl").

The repository is still evolving. We welcome your feedback, issue reports,
and pull requests.

A separate repository, [bsc-contrib],
exists for sharing libraries and utilities that don't (or don't yet) belong in
the core tools.

A graphical environment for using BSC is available in a separate [bdw]
repository. BDW (the BSC Development Workstation) provides a number of
tools, including the ability to view simulation waveforms as
source-level values.

## Download

For the following systems, the Bluespec toolchain is available
as a package that can be installed with the standard package manager:

* ArchLinux AUR: [`bluespec-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bluespec-git/) ([among others](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=bluespec))
* Nix/NixOS: [`bluespec`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=20.09&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&query=bluespec)

If a package exists for your system, we recommend installing that.
Otherwise, a tar-archive may be available for download from our
[Releases](https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc/releases) page.
Install instructions can be found inside the tar-file.

If a pre-built tar-file does not exist for your system,
you will need to [compile BSC from source](INSTALL.md).

## Documentation

More details on using BSC, Bluesim, and Bluetcl can be found in the
_BSC User Guide_.

The standard libraries that come with BSC are documented in the
_BSC Libraries Reference Guide_.

The sources for both of these documents are found in the `doc`
directory of this repo.  Pre-built PDF files can be downloaded from
the [Releases](https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc/releases) page.

Language documentation, training, and tutorials can be found in the
[BSVlang repository](https://github.com/BSVLang/Main).
