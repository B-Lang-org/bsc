This directory contains an GNU enscript "st" file for the Bluespec
SystemVerilog language.  

Enscript converts ASCII files to PostScript and spools generated
PostScript output to the specified printer or leaves it to
file. Enscript can be easily extended to handle different output media
and it has many options that can be used to customize printouts.
GNU Enscript can be found at:  http://people.ssh.fi/mtr/genscript/index.html

To add enscript support for Bluespec SystemVerilog (bsv) files, copy
bsv.st to the appropriate enscript library, usually
/usr/share/enscript/hl/.  Then add a bsv entry line to the file
"enscript.st", also found in the enscript library.  The line will look
like:
       /\.bsv$/    bsv;

This procedure was tested with GNU enscript 1.6.4.  Please report bugs
or problems to support@bluespec.com
