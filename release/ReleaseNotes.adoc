2021.07 Release
---------------

Welcome to the first release of open BSC!
Thank you and congratulations to everyone involved!

We have decided on the convention YYYY.MM for naming releases.
And we have decided on a release schedule of twice a year,
in January and July.  Therefore, this first release is 2021.07
and users can expect a next release, 2022.01, in six months.
Patch releases, if needed, will be named 2021.07.1, etc.

This release has some incompatibilities with prior proprietary
releases, but for the most part remains the same.  Hopefully
all projects using prior releases should find it accessible to
migrate to this open release.  But users should expect that
more incompatible changes may be coming in future releases.
Examples of changes to expect include:

* Renaming and reorganizing of directories in the release

* Renaming of Verilog primitives
  (for example, to start with a unique prefix such as `__BSC_`)

* Renaming of preprocessor macros
  (for example, changing the prefix `BSV_` to `BSC_`)

* New preprocessor macros
  (for example, rather than having Vivado-specific versions
  of Verilog primitives in a separate directory, they may
  coexist in one file and users may need to define a macro
  such as `VIVADO`, to select for the target tool)

* Use of newer Verilog features
  (rather than restricting primitives and generated Verilog to
  the Verilog95 standard as much as possible)

The changes in this release are highlighted below.
In addition, it is worth acknowledging the logistical and community
changes.  Most communication around open BSC happens on GitHub;
however, we also now have mailing lists, hosted at Groups.io.

Only the core BSC tools have been included in the open BSC project
(compiler, standard libraries, Bluesim, and Bluetcl).  Some libraries
have been released in a separate GitHub repository,
https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc-contrib[`bsc-contrib`].
And BDW, the Bluespec Development Workstation GUI, has been released
as its own GitHub project,
https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bdw[`bdw`].
Other features from the proprietary release (such as BlueNoC, SCE-MI,
and other emulation tools and transactor libraries) have not been
released.

Highlights since proprietary release 2019.05:

Licensing
~~~~~~~~~

* FlexLM licensing has been removed from BSC and Bluesim, along with
  related flags

* Source is provided under the BSD-3-Clause license, except for some
  components where specified (under other open/copyleft licenses)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The documentation for standard libraries, that was previously found
  in the BSV Language Manual, has been collected into a stand-alone
  document, now residing in the `bsc` repo so that it can be updated
  as the libraries are updated

* BDW documentation has been removed from the User Guide and placed in
  its own document in the `bdw` repo; the remainder of the User Guide
  resides in the `bsc` repo where hopefully it can be updated
  as features are updated

General
~~~~~~~

* Users no longer need to set `BLUESPECDIR` -- the executables will
  expect the directory to sit at a known location relative to the
  executables

* The locations for C++ libraries (SAT, VPI, Bluesim) are no longer
  under a CXXFAMILY directory (for example, `g++4_64`)

* Version information no longer includes a date, just a build number
  (usually a git hash) and a version name (now reported as a single
  string instead of three separate fields)

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

* Removed unnecessary library requirements (X11, Tcl/Tk)
  ** Previously, the BSC executable required dynamic linking
     with Tcl, Tk, and X11 libraries -- which were legitimately
     needed for Bluetcl and Bluewish, but not for BSC

* Removed `Prelude` directory and consolidated all the libraries into
  the `Libraries` directory

* Flags and special support for BlueNoC/SCE-MI have been removed

* New flags `-show-timestamps` and `-show-version`

* New flag `-quiet` and its short form `-q`

* Yices is now the default SMT solver and the library is now included
  ** Support is updated to the latest version (2.6.2)
  ** Bugs have been fixed in BSC's use of Yices

* Support for CUDD solver removed, along with associated flags for
  scheduler effort and BDD cache size

* Better code generation for tagged unions and for enums that are
  non-consecutive or non-zero-based
  ** Pack-unpack of types results in pure wires in more cases
  ** More optimized code should occur in other situations, with fewer
     unnecessary case-statements

* Improved the handling of struct/union fields (in patterns,
  selection, and value construction)
  ** The BSV parser now accepts a pattern syntax for matching structs
  ** BSV syntax for struct vs tagged union can no longer be used
     interchangeably (users may need to add or remove the `tagged`
     keyword in existing code); this also means that clash between
     namespaces is no longer a problem
  ** BH/Classic still uses the same syntax for both structs and
     constructors with named fields, so the type checker still
     uses heuristics to decide which is intended -- this process
     has been improved
  ** Parsing/type-checking is now more strict about when named
     vs unnamed fields can be used
  ** Empty braces (without any listed fields) are disallowed in
     BSV syntax in situations where this does not make sense

* Record updates are now allowed on interfaces

* In BH/Classic, `prefix` is no longer a reserved keyword, and is now
  supported as an alternate to `prefixs` port renaming pragma

* Type-level strings are now supported, as a new string kind
  (alongside numeric and star kinds)
  ** The pseudo-function `stringOf` exists for converting a string
     type to a string value (along the lines of `valueOf` for
     numeric types)

* Fixed some `combsched` internal errors in scheduling

* Fixed an internal error on mutually recursive type class instances

* Fixed an issue where parallel calls to BSC would conflict if they
  used the C preprocessor, because it created a temporary file with a
  hard-coded name (fixed to use a unique name now)

* Fixed a bug in static evaluation of SLE/SLT on 0-width values

* Other efficiency improvements, error message improvements, and bug fixes
  ** Releases are also built with newer GHC versions, which ought to
     improve performance


Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

* Experimental support in the Prelude for datatype-generic functions,
  based on GHC's Generics:
  https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/GHC-Generics.html

* New `CShow` library (implemented with Generics), which provides a
  `CShow` typeclass that acts similar to `FShow` but prints values in
  BH/Classic syntax

* An instance of `FShow` is derived for `Either`

* The `DefaultValue` typeclass is now in `Prelude`, so it is
  automatically available and does not require importing a separate
  package

* The `guarded` parameter on FIFO primitives was fixed to be of type
  `Bool` rather than `Integer`

* Fix to `SquareRoot` library

Bluetcl
~~~~~~~

* The executable links with the locally installed Tcl/Tk and Itlk/Itk
  (rather than being compiled with source snapshots for specific
  versions) which also means that any locally installed Tcl libraries
  are available for use in Bluetcl

* The separate `bluewish` executable has been removed -- now that
  local libraries are used, Bluetcl users can `require` the local Tk
  package, to pull in Tk/X11 support

* Removed unnecessary library requirements (X11, Tk)
  ** Bluetcl can be run on systems where Tk/X11 is not available,
     as long as the Bluetcl commands don't request it

* `TCLLIBPATH` and `BLUETCLLIBPATH` environment variables are
  supported, for listing directories to add to the search path for
  packages

Bluesim
~~~~~~~

* Fixed code generation for conditionally called ActionValue
  methods/tasks

* Improved a scaling issue in Bluesim linking

* Handles `SIGPIPE` the same as Ctrl-C

Verilog
~~~~~~~

* Fixed typos in the Quartus versions of the Verilog primitives for
  BRAMs

* Fixed BSC linking for Icarus Verilog, so that the Verilog search
  path is also used for finding preprocessor include files

* BSC linking now supported for Questa (using `-vsim questa`)

* BSC linking for ModelSim updated to remove deprecated flag
