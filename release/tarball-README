-------------------------

This directory can be moved to anywhere on your system, but it is best
for the files to remain in their relative positions within the
directory.

We recommend placing this directory under `/opt`, `${HOME}/`,
`/usr/share/`, or similar location.  For example:

    $ mkdir -p /opt/tools/bsc
    $ mv bsc-<VERSION> /opt/tools/bsc/bsc-<VERSION>
    $ cd /opt/tools/bsc
    $ ln -s bsc-<VERSION> latest

This directory has a 'bin' subdirectory, where the executables for the
tools are found.  To use the tools, just add that directory to your
`PATH`:

    $ export PATH=/opt/tools/bsc/latest/bin:$PATH

These executables will make use of other files found within this
directory, locating them relatively from the `bin` directory.  That is
why the directory must be kept together.

-------------------------

Run the following to see command-line options on the executable:

    $ bsc -help

Additional flags of use to developers can be displayed with the
following command:

    $ bsc -help-hidden

More details on using BSC, Bluesim, and Bluetcl can be found in the
BSC User Guide, in the `doc` subdirectory.
